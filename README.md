# BasicDiskStressTest

This repository contains simple scripts for basic disk stress testing in three different languages: Rust, Python, and PowerShell. Each script writes a file with random data to the disk and then copies it, stressing both write and read operations.

## Scripts

The repository includes the following scripts:

1. `rust/src/main.rs`: A Rust script for disk stress testing.
2. `python/BasicDiskStressTest/main.py`: A Python script for disk stress testing.
3. `powershell/BasicDiskStressTest.ps1`: A PowerShell script for disk stress testing.

## Usage

Please refer to the individual README.md files in each script's directory for more specific usage instructions and information.
